In this project you'll use JQuery UI autocomplete widget.

MOVE wants to add a "Find your city" form that lists their locations around the world.
As you type letters into the form, results are auto-suggested.


Developers have extended jQuery's functionality by building new libraries on top of it. One of these libraries
is called jQuery UI. With jQuery UI, you can quickly add other common interactive components to a web page instead
of writing it yourself, like datepickers, sliders, and accordions..

We'll use jQuery UI's autocomplete widget for MOVE's home page.
